            <div class="projectDescription">I designed and implemented an internal report to help diagnose customer service tickets. Throughout the internship, I participated in Agile ceremonies including daily standup, sprint planning, and grooming. While working on my main project, I collaborated with other teams to test new, more efficient code patterns and fixed bugs.

            <div class="projectDescription">I supported the Dimensional Insight R&D team and participated in daily Agile scrums. My main projects were developing a Treemap chart, a Hexbin map layer, and part of an internal bookmarking system. I also upgraded and debugged older code.

            <div class="projectDescription"><a href="https://programmetry.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Programmetry</a> is a website I originally made for an Independent Study Project and later continued as a personal project. The works from the academic project explored computational poetry and the intersection between poetry and interactive art. The website includes pieces such as "global pandemic", a poem inscribed into a Python program using all 33 Python 3 keywords, "This Person does not Exist", a context free grammar that generates a new poem on each page load, and "You are in Control", which experiments with poetry, movement, and user interaction. Later works under the Programmetry project focused more on visuals being combined with words, sound, and user interaction to create an experience.</div>
